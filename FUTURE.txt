Sample player could use envelope with delayed attack curve and offset position so that sample-accurate precision can be achieved.

The scheduler offsets with sample-accurate timing should be controllable via some control change message / note on message so that the scheduler offset corresponds to a note (a frequency).

The MIDI channel on which the device listens should be setable when the device boots up, perhaps by holding down some combination of switches.

The scheduler should be syncable with MIDI sync messages.
