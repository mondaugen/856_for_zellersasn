# 856 for ZELLERSASN - Manual

## Introduction

The 856 for ZELLERSASN (856) is a looper and sample sequencer. Samples are taken
of different parts of a loop and played back in various rhythms and at different
pitches. A designed sequence can be stored and can be applied to new recordings
(loops).

## Particularities

The knobs give the user the ability to design sequences. This should be kept in
mind when adjusting the knobs: what you adjust may not immediately be audible as
you are setting a parameter that will be changed the next time a sample plays.

The momentary switches "acknowledge" a press when they are released. For
example, when you want to record a loop (in A=R mode), press and hold the record
footswitch on the left and release it when you want to start recording. When you
want to stop recording press and hold the record footswitch and release when you
want recording to end.
