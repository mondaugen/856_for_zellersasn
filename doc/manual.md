# The 856 for ZELLERSASN Manual

## Introduction

The 856 for ZELLERSASN (856) is a looper and sample sequencer. Samples are taken
of different parts of a loop and played back in various rhythms and at different
pitches. A designed sequence can be stored and can be applied to new recordings
(loops).

## Particularities

The knobs give the user the ability to design sequences. This should be kept in
mind when adjusting the knobs: what you adjust may not immediately be audible as
you are setting a parameter that will be changed the next time a sample plays.

Recording works as follows: press and release the left footswitch to start
recording. Press and release it again to stop.

You can only record for a maximum of 20 seconds. After this time, the recording
will automatically stop.

## Terminology

When we say "parameter" in this manual, we refer to the value that a particular
knob represents. For example, the "pitch" knob controls the pitch parameter.

When we say "click a switch" in this manual, we mean press and release a switch.
The time between pressing and releasing should be short, but it actually doesn't
matter if nothing else changes while the switch is down (no knob is turned,
etc.).

## Setting up

The pedal is on moments after it is plugged in (it takes a few milliseconds to
boot up). The power socket on the back is for a 9 volt adapter with a negative
tip and a positive shell (this is standard for most guitar pedals). The 856
can pull up to 300 mA and so requires a power supply that can supply at least
that much current.

Looking from the top, the 1/4 inch jack furthest to the right is the audio input
and the one just to the left of it the audio output.

The jack just to the left of the audio output jack is for incoming MIDI
messages.

## Tutorial

Before going through all the controls on the 856, we'll take you through a
tutorial to get a flavour for what can be done with it.

See the "setting up" section to set up the pedal before proceeding.

To reset all the parameters hold the STRIDE/ABS/(UNI) switch in the down
position while clicking the FADE/GAIN/(FBK) switch in the downward direction
twice.

Set the controls to control note set 1 by putting the N1/BAR/N2/N3 switch in the
upward position.

Put the pedal in R=B mode by putting the FREE/R=B/AREC switch in the middle
position.

The rest of the switches can stay as they are for now.

Play a loop you are interested in recording. The first time we recommend just
playing a note and letting it sound, then recording it for 1 or 2 seconds --
what is going on will be clearer this way. Click the left footswitch and to
start recording. Click the switch to stop. The loop you played should now be
playing.

As the N1/BAR/N2/N3 switch is in the upward position and we are in A=R mode, the
TMPO/REP knob only slightly changes the tempo. This is useful for adjusting your
loop if it wasn't quite recorded right. The &#x394; knob controls the tempo more
coarsely if the FREE/QUANT/SKIP switch is in the upward position. If in the
middle position, it doubles, triples or quadruples the tempo depending on the
&#x394; knob's position. This knob turned all the way clockwise does no scaling
to the tempo, it turned all the way counter-clockwise quadruples the tempo.

With the FADE/GAIN/(FBK) switch in the middle position, turn the GAIN knob all
the way counter-clockwise. The loop should not sound the next time it plays (the
gain adjustment will not be immediate). Put the N1/BAR/N2/N3 switch in the
middle position. You are now controlling the second note set. Turn the LEN knob
to about half, the TMPO/REP knob to about half. Set the FREE/QUANT/SKIP to the
middle position and turn the &#x394; knob to the middle. Now turn up the GAIN
knob to maximum. You should hear many repeated copies of the beginning of your
loop. Try adjusting the TMPO/REP knob to add fewer or more copies. Try adjusting
the &#x394; knob to change the time between the repeats.

You can choose to sample a different part of your loop. To do this, set the
STRIDE/ABS/(UNI) knob in the middle position and move the POS knob. You will
hear the part of the loop that is sampled change based on where the POS knob is.

The pitch of the repeats can be controlled. Set the TMPO/REP knob to maximum to
get a lot of repeats. We can control the pitches of sub-sets of the repeated
notes. The P1/P2/P3 switch set in the upward position allows controlling the
pitch of the 1st playback and 3rd, 6th ... repeats. This switch in the middle
position controls the pitch of the 1st, 4th ... repeats and in the bottom
position controls the pitch of the 2nd, 5th ... repeats. With the PITCH knob set
to a different position for each of the P1/P2/P3 switch settings, you should
hear a sort of arpeggio in the repeats (or chord if the time between the repeats
is short).

You can make the repeats fade out or fade in by setting the FADE/GAIN/(FBK)
switch to the upward position. The GAIN knob turned counter-clockwise will cause
the repeats to fade out, there will be no fading if it is in the middle and the
repeats will fade in if the knob is turned to the right. For fading in to be
audible, the overall GAIN should not be maximum as the fading in is stopped when
the notes would clip. To experience this, set the FADE/GAIN/(FBK) switch to the
middle position and turn the GAIN knob to the middle. Then set the
FADE/GAIN/(FBK) switch back to the top position and turn the GAIN knob to the
right. You should hear the notes fade in.

Our original loop is still present, just turned down. To hear it along with what
you've set up on note 2, set the N1/BAR/N2/N3 switch to the top position, set
the FADE/GAIN/(FBK) switch to the middle position and turn the GAIN knob to the
top (if it is already at the top, turn the knob down then up again). You should
hear the original loop with the repeats you created on note 2 playing at the
same time as the beginning of the loop. We can change when these repeats occur
relative to note 1. Set the N1/BAR/N2/N3 switch to the middle position. Now
adjust the OFST knob. You should hear the repeats of note 2 starting sometime
within the loop playing on note 1 -- when OFST is all the way counter-clockwise,
the repeats start at the beginning of the loop and all the way clockwise they
start at the end (which is close to the beginning as it's a loop).

If you like what you've created and want to apply it to other loops, you can
save the parameters by setting the PRE1/PRE2/PRE3 switch and clicking the
STR-RCL switch upwards. To recall the setting later select the preset with the
PRE1/PRE2/PRE3 switch and click the STR-RCL downwards.

## Controls

### Left footswitch

Starts and stops recording. The command is acknowledged as soon as the switch is
pressed down.

### Right footswitch

Starts and stops playback. The command is acknowledged as soon as the switch is
pressed down.

### ENV

Controls the amplitude shape of a playing note. Turned counter-clockwise,
produces an amplitude envelope with slow attack and fast decay. Clockwise is an
amplitude envelope with fast attack and slow decay. The envelope when in the
middle has a slow attack and decay. In between you can find varying speeds for
the attack and decay.

Note that the envelope also applies to a loop. If in the middle position for
example, this will give long attacks and decays to your loop, which you may or
may not want. When recording a loop in R=B mode, the loop is automatically given
an envelope with short attack and decay.

### N1/BAR/N2/N3

Controls what note set you are controlling. In the upward position, controls
N1/BAR (we say "BAR" because TMPO/REP, FREE/QUANT/SKIP and &#x394; behave
different from N2 and N3 in this setting). In the middle and lower positions
controls N2 and N3 respectively.

### LEN

Controls the length of the notes samples from your recording. Fully clockwise
plays for the time of the whole loop (we say time of the whole loop because if
PITCH were set to 1 octave above, it would play through the loop twice as it is
playing at double the speed). This knob set in the middle is not half the loop
because the accuracy with which you can choose the length increases as you turn
the knob counter-clockwise. This is so you can accurately cut out small segments
from your loop, like a note or a specific drum, but choose the length of longer
samples less precisely. You can't have your cake and eat it with such a small
knob! (For more accuracy, check out the MIDI controls.)

### FREE/R=B/AREC

Determines what happens when you stop recording.

In FREE mode your recording does not affect the current tempo (see TMPO/REP for
how to choose the tempo).

In R=B mode the length of your recording adjusts the tempo so that the notes of
N1 are played with a delay equal to the length of your recording. This
effectively creates a looping sensation. If the FBK light is on (see
FADE/GAIN/(FBK)) then the gain of N2 and N3 is turned down so they do not play.
This is so you can record what the 856 is playing and have it play like a loop
without the sampling of the other notes making it sound chaotic. As a
side-effect, the timing determined by the &#x394; and OFST knobs are all based
on the length determined by the length of your recording. 

AREC mode is the same as R=B mode except that after you have recorded a loop,
the 856 records automatically again and again for the length that you recorded
the first time. This allows you to apply your sequence to what you just played.
If you have recorded a loop in R=B mode and would like to record for exactly its
length, while the loop is playing in R=B mode, switch to AREC mode, then press
and release the REC button. Recording might not happen immediately but will
start when the start of the loop happens then restart at the end of the loop. If
you want to keep what is currently playing, press and release the REC button.

### TMPO/REP

This knob serves two functions: when N1/BAR is selected it controls the tempo of
the loop or sequence. When N2 or N3 are selected, it determines the number of
repeats that are played of that note. This means repeats are not available for
the first note set.

When N1/BAR is selected, the knob's function changes depending on the position
of FREE/A=B/AREC. When FREE/R=B/AREC is in FREE mode, the knob controls the tempo so that in fully
counter-clockwise position, the there are 40 loops per minute (40 playings of
N1) and in fully clockwise position, there are 240 loops per minute.

In R=B mode the knob slightly nudges the tempo: turning clockwise makes it
slightly faster and counter-clockwise slightly slower.

In AREC mode it behaves the same as in R=B mode.

### FREE/QUANT/SKIP

This switch controls the function of the &#x394; knob. The functions available
change depending on the N1/BAR/N2/N3 switch. The following describes the various
selections depending on whether or not the N1/BAR mode is selected or N2 or N3
is selected.

#### FREE

If N1/BAR selected, &#x394; controls the tempo so that if &#x394; is fully
counter-clockwise 10 beats per minute are subtracted from its rate and if
clockwise 10 beats per minute are added to it. A sort of fine tempo adjustment.

If N2 or N3 selected, &#x394; controls the amount of time between the repeats of
the notes. &#x394; in fully clockwise position, the time between repeats is
equal to the length of the loop, &#x394; in fully counter-clockwise position,
the time is 1/64 the length of the loop. N.B.: After reset (see (UNI)) the time
between repeats is 0 until the &#x394; knob is adjusted.

#### QUANT

If N1/BAR selected, &#x394; controls doubling, tripling or quadrupling of the
tempo. &#x394; in the fully counter-clockwise position causes tempo quadrupling
and in the fully clockwise position no tempo scaling occurs.

If N2 or N3 are selected, &#x394; controls the time between repeats as fractions
of the loop length. From counter-clockwise to clockwise position, the fractions
are from 1/16, through 1/12, 1/8, 1/6, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, to 3/4.

#### SKIP

This behaves the same for N1/BAR, N2 and N3. It determines how many loops to
wait until playing the set of notes again. Each note set can be set
individually. This is useful to play different note sets with different
densities as sometimes your sequences might get too cluttered. &#x394; in the
fully counter-clockwise position, the note set is played every loop. In the
fully clockwise position, for every 4 loops, the note set plays only 1 time. In
between more frequent choices are possible, like once every 2 or 3 loops.

### &#x394;

Controls many things. See the other controls for clarification.

### P1/P2/P3

Controls what pitch in the repeats the PITCH knob affects. P1 means PITCH
changes the pitch of the 1st, 4th, etc. notes. P2 the 2nd, 5th etc. notes and so
on.

### STRIDE/ABS/(UNI)

If in the central position, ABS, the POS knob controls absolutely where samples
are taken from in the recording. If the POS knob is in the fully
counter-clockwise position, samples are taken from the beginning, if in the
clockwise position, samples are taken from the end.

If in the upward position, STRIDE, the POS knob controls the rate at which the
sample selection is advanced through positions in the sample. A
counter-clockwise position of the POS knob advances backward and a clockwise
position of the POS knob advances forward. The knob in the centre does not
advance the start position of sampling.

#### (UNI)

If the STRIDE/ABS/(UNI) switch clicked down without adjusting any other controls
while the switch is down, the pitches of the repeated notes (previously set via
P1/P2/P3 and PITCH) are reset to unison, that is, their pitches are not altered.

If held down while adjusting the PITCH knob, the pitches of all repeats for the
currently selected note set are adjusted simultaneously. This is useful if you
would like to have repeated notes at a different pitch, but no arpeggio effect.

If held down while adjusting the &#x394; knob when N2 or N3 is selected,
controls swing applied to the rhythm that separates the repeats. Putting the
knob in the middle position gives no swing.

If held down and the (FBK) switch is clicked (the bottom position of the
FADE/GAIN/(FBK) switch), the gains of N2 and N3 are set to 0 (they are
silenced). Their settings still remain.

If held down and the (FBK) switch is clicked twice, all the settings are reset
and only N1/BAR plays as if a recording had just been made using R=B mode.

### PITCH

Controls the pitch of the repeat selected with P1/P2/P3 (or all pitches if (UNI)
held down). Turned fully counter-clockwise, the note is transposed down an
octave and fully clockwise up an octave. The transpositions are quantized to the
nearest semi-tone. The transposition also affects the length of the playback.

### PRE1/PRE2/PRE3

Chooses what preset is stored or recalled using the STR/-/RCL switch.

### POS

Chooses either where sampling starts within the recording or the velocity of
sampling-start advancement according to the STRIDE/ABS/(UNI) switch.

### OFST

Chooses when the note set plays relative to when the BEAT light blinks. If in
the fully counter-clockwise position, the note set starts playing at the same
time as the BEAT light's illumination. If in the middle position the note set
starts playing at the time half way between two flashes of the BEAT light.

### FADE/GAIN/(FBK)

In the middle position, the GAIN knob controls the loudness of the note set.

In the top position, this controls the fading of repeated notes. If turned
counter-clockwise, the repeated notes fade-out and if turned clockwise, the
repeated notes fade-in. The gain is limited to 1. to avoid clipping, so to get a
dramatic fade-in effect, the gain setting may need to be turned down (the GAIN
knob turned counter-clockwise with the FADE/GAIN/(FBK) switch in the middle
position) before dialing-in a fade-in effect.

The (FBK) position can be clicked, which will enable feedback in the FREE and R=B
modes. If FBK is on (the FBK light illuminated), when recording, the output of
the pedal is also recorded. Feedback is not available in the AREC mode. (FBK)
can also be used to reset note parameters, see STRIDE/ABS/(UNI).

### GAIN

Controls the loudness of the notes or their fading, depending on the setting of
the FADE/GAIN/(FBK) switch.

## MIDI

Before you can control the device via MIDI messages it is necessary to set the
channel of the MIDI messages it responds to. By default it responds to messages
on channel 1. If you have a new device and you have never set up the MIDI
channel and are content with the 856 only responding to messages transmitted on
channel 1 then you can skip this step. Otherwise follow the following
instructions:

Turn off the 856 by unplugging it. Set the switches in the top row according to
the MIDI channel you would like to set. See the following table for the
settings:

For example, if you would like the 856 to respond to MIDI messages transmitted
on channel 10, set the top left-hand switch to the upward position, the top
middle-left switch to the middle or downward position, the top middle-right switch to the middle
or downward position and the top right-hand switch to the upward position.

Now, while holding the (UNI) switch down, plug in the power to the back of the
pedal. The MIDI channel you selected should display briefly on the LEDs using the same
pattern as in the table (the illuminated LEDs will correspond to switches in the
upward position, the dark LEDs to those in the middle or downward position).
Shortly afterward, the pedal will continue to power up normally.
It should now respond to messages on the channel you chose. Note that for
channel 1, no LEDs will be illuminated.

### MIDI note on messages

Sending a MIDI note on message on the channel the 856 is set up to listen on
will play back one iteration of the loop or sequence. The pitch value will scale
all the pitches accordingly: a pitch value of 60 means no transposition, 72
means all pitches are transposed 1 octave up, 48 means they are all transposed
one octave down, etc. The velocity value scales the GAIN value of all notes. 127
means no scaling, 63 is a scaling of about half, etc. Note off messages are
ignored. 

### MIDI clock

The 856 can be synchronized to external hardware by sending it a MIDI
clock. To see if this is active, hold down the UNI switch. If the first
LED is lit up it means the 856 is using internal scheduling, if the second LED
is lit up, it means it is listening for a MIDI clock to control its scheduling.
To toggle between the two modes click the PLAY footswitch while holding down the
UNI switch. You should see the LED change to indicate what mode has been set.
Note that in MIDI clock mode no playback will happen if no clock is being sent!
The 856 expects 24 MIDI clock messages per quarter note, which is compatible with most
hardware.
