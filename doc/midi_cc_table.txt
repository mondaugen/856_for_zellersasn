 55 | Preset store | Store the current settings in a specified register. The message value of 0 stores in the PRE1 register, a value of 1 stores in the PRE2 register and a value of 2 stores in the PRE3 register. If greater than 2, stores in the PRE3 register. 
 56 | Preset recall | Recall the current settings from a specified register. The message value of 0 recalls from the PRE1 register, a value of 1 recalls from the PRE2 register and a value of 2 recalls from the PRE3 register.  If greater than 2, recalls from the PRE3 register.
