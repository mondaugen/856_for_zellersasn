When recording with overdub and 1 measure is made to equal recording time after recording, make volume of note 1 = 1 so that the amplitude doesn't drop.

When recording for too long, what happens? The recording should end as if you toggled the recording switch.

Does the frequency knob sometimes not work?

Each note should have its own pool of allocated notes so that notes aren't ignored... (??). Maybe not...

Some preset fields shouldn't be stored, for instance, the "mode" field.

What is the initial preset when the device ships?

Is the gain setting correct? See scheduling.c to see what I mean.

- beat stride and repeat stride feature
    - normal stride is now beat stride
- tempo should be logarithmic, fine control fills in gaps precisely
- try out limiter
