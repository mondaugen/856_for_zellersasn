When recording with overdub and 1 measure is made to equal recording time after recording, make volume of note 1 = 1 so that the amplitude doesn't drop.

When recording for too long, what happens? The recording should end as if you toggled the recording switch.

Does the frequency knob sometimes not work?

Each note should have its own pool of allocated notes so that notes aren't ignored... (??). Maybe not...

Some preset fields shouldn't be stored, for instance, the "mode" field.

What is the initial preset when the device ships?

Is the gain setting correct? See scheduling.c to see what I mean.

- beat stride and repeat stride feature
    - normal stride is now beat stride
    - incorporate into MIDI
    -> done
- tempo should be logarithmic, fine control fills in gaps precisely
    -> done, but precisely filling in the gaps is hard to make compatible with
       MIDI while also having the panel have a different resolution, so we just
       scale by +- 10% for fine tempo control.
- try out limiter
    -> done

- len should maybe adapt according to the playback speed (ah but what pitch to use?)
    - maybe just the len of the first note (N1)
- abs only changes at the beginning of a note group! it should change at each repeat
    -> done
- maybe OFFSET should be multiplied by the number of skips?
- we don't need to clip FADE to 1 because we have the limiter now
    -> done

- recalling presets when there are none make the pedal explode basically
    -> this has been fixed, you just need to reset presets, or erase entire flash

- Somehow, the bad value of MIDI channel -1 was stored in the MIDI channel. This
  shouldn't happen. What should happen is the flash should be seen as
  uninitialized, then get intialized, then the MIDI channel in the intialized
  flash (0) should be stored.
    -> fixed, if this happens, channel 0 is stored to flash
- There's still sort of a blow up when you move fade from a value > 1 and back to 1
- Shouldn't the fade rate be 1 when the knob is in the middle?

- length control should be like 1/16 1/8 1/4 etc. no?
- If you record with R=B or AREC and then change the tempo, it might be nice to be able to go back.
- Was it always that recording in R=B w/o FBK doesn't zero N2 and N3?
    -> yes, this is so you can apply the sequencing and stuff to newly recorded audio
- MIDI Playback adds set of additional notes. It should be that it does that for a value of 2, but for a value of 1 it stops and restarts playback.
- MIDI CC controlling record mode doesn't work.
    -> fixed

- Add 2 feedback modes, one where only N1 fed back and the other where all output fed back.
    --> done

- Something is wrong with the envelope because it still clicks even when the wavetable is windowed
    - not sure if this was from test or not...
- Sometimes there are still buffer underruns, need to optimize a bit more
